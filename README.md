This is a repository for the project sent home with me from API. Included is the source code and a compiled WAR file under the releases tab. I tested the WAR file under both Windows running the latest Tomcat 6 and Ubuntu running Tomcat 6, so it should be fine in any environment.

Please note that the Maven .pom compile script is not working yet and doesn't include proper libs or the .xhtml files. I should have an update for this soon.
